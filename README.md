# ContextSRH

This repository contains the labeled contextual questions dataset, ContextSRH, from the paper "Evaluating Biases in Context-Dependent Health Questions". The file contains each question and its source. If the question is dependent on an attribute (i.e. age, sex, or location), the appropriate column is marked with an 'x'.
